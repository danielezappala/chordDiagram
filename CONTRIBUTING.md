Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Chord Diagram Library!
This project is developed primarily as a didactic and hobbyist initiative, with the aim of learning, experimenting, and sharing useful tools with the community.
A significant part of the development has benefited from the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have provided guidance, code suggestions, and helped shape the direction of the project.
